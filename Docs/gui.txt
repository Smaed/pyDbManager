GTK

Probably my first choice if it was not going to be cross platform.
How ever i would like to keep it dependency free and that rules GTK out.


Pros:

	Fits well in a *nix enviroment
	Some nice features


Cons:
	
	Not in standard library on windows and maby mac os


Tkinter

Nice toolkit that is also in the standard library for at least win/*nix/mac, wich
makes it one of the number one choices.


Pros:

	In standard library


Cons:

	Does not look as nice on linux as GTK


qt/wxPython

Both is out simply because they are not in the standard library on any platform
and on windows i would rather use tkinter and on linux GTK3


Webinterface:

showing it would be the best cross-platform solution there is always
the problem of running it. Should it be run serverside / clientside /both.
