Shortlist of features.


1). Handle many different SQL databases with support for almost any database usinghandlers for the different types. 

2). No dependencies, if a handler uses a module that is not in the standard library it will not be loaded, and the interface informs and does not show the handler specific graphics. 

In order for this to function it's probably best if the interface assumes there is no handlers until told otherwise.

3). Multiple language support. 

4). Interface knows how to show things, database handler knows what to show.

For example, all databases have different datatypes, interface knows where to show them but has to ask the handler for a list of wich there are.
