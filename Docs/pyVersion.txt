Current options:

pyton 2.7.x

python 3.2 / 3.4


Both the 2.x and 3.x branches have their perks and since the GUI will
probably be using tkinter wich exists in both 2 and 3 I can't realy see a problem
with using python 3.

In the end it comes down to how the support for various databases look, and
at least SQLite3 support exists in both python 2 and 3.


There is always a third route, trying to make it cross-version. This might be
the right path now but it can also introduce unexpected problems if it isn't
tested properly on several versions of python during development.
