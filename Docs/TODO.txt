1.

Fix the general GUI, and draw up the final design of a gui with no handler


2.

Decide on how the GUI should be done with different handlers pressent,
it would probably be best if there was a factory class making the GUI
depending on what needs the handlers have,

i.e 

if Loginbox == None: Filebox


3. 

Create a general class for the handlers, it should be most effective if all
handlers only change the specifics for that database.


4.

Creating the argparse and configparse functions, adding the default values will be a later problem. 
I also want the db handlers to hook into this and supply default values

Mysql: foreign keys = True | False
SQLite foreign keys = True | False
