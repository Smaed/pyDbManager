1.

Fix the general GUI, and draw up the final design of a gui with no handler


2.

Decide on how the GUI should be done with different handlers pressent,
it would probably be best if there was a factory class making the GUI
depending on what needs the handlers have,

i.e 

if Loginbox == None: Filebox


3. 

Create a general class for the handlers, it should be most effective if all
handlers only change the specifics for that database.
